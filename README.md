# DigiWater

## Product Vision

Our mobile application is designed to address the concerns of travelers, hikers and adventurers regarding the quality of water in Gerês' lakes, rivers, lagoons and small creeks. Through intuitive visualizations and metrics, DigiWater will empower travelers with crucial information about the safety of water in Gerês, helping them make informed decisions about hydration and fun.

While existing water testing devices are not mobile phone-compatible, DigiWater leverages publicly available data to offer comprehensive assessments without the need for specialized hardware. In the future we aim to extend our vision globally, recognizing the diverse water quality challenges faced by travelers across continents, from Europe to Africa and beyond.

DigiWater aims to become the go-to companion for travelers seeking reassurance and guidance on water quality, empowering them to explore with confidence and stay healthy throughout their journeys.
