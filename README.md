# DigiWater

## Product Vision

DigiWater is the go-to app for travelers who want to have a safe water-drinking experience in all their trips. Good and safe water is everything!

Our mobile application is designed to address the concerns of travelers regarding the quality of drinking water in their destination countries. Our app will aggregate and compare water quality data between the user's home country and their travel destination. Through intuitive visualizations and metrics, DigiWater will empower travelers with crucial information about the safety and taste of tap water, helping them make informed decisions about hydration while abroad.

While existing water testing devices are not mobile phone-compatible, DigiWater leverages publicly available data and user-contributed insights to offer comprehensive assessments without the need for specialized hardware. Our vision extends globally, recognizing the diverse water quality challenges faced by travelers across continents, from Europe to Africa and beyond.

DigiWater aims to become the go-to companion for travelers seeking reassurance and guidance on water quality, empowering them to explore with confidence and stay healthy throughout their journeys.
